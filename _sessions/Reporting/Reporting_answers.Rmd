In this practical, I will analyse the `mcdonalds` datasets and show reproducible results in a dynamic document are created in R Markdown. R Markdown is great because I can integrate `code` directly into my document, and easily use *italics* and **bold** using formatting tags.

### Overview

```{r, out.width = "30%", fig.cap="Source: Wikipedia"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Cheeseburger.jpg/2560px-Cheeseburger.jpg")
```

The `mcdonalds` data contains `r ncol(mcdonalds)` pieces of information for `r nrow(mcdonalds)` menu items. The data originally comes from [https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts](https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts). 


### Data

Here is a table showing the first 6 columns and 10 rows of the dataset. You can scroll through the dataset and search for specific items you are interested in.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(mcdonalds %>% select(1:6))
```

### Calories Histogram

Across all items, the mean number of calories is `r mean(mcdonalds$Calories)`. The following plot is a histogram showing the distribution of calories across all menu items:

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = Calories)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

The dataset contains several items with zero calories: `r mcdonalds %>% filter(Calories == min(Calories)) %>% pull(Item)` and one item with the maximum amount of calories: `r mcdonalds %>% filter(Calories == max(Calories)) %>% pull(Item)` of `r mcdonalds %>% filter(Calories == max(Calories)) %>% pull(Calories)` kCal.

### Calories and Sodium Scatterplot

Is there a relationship between the number of calories and sodium in mcdonalds items? To answer this, let's start by showing a scatterplot:

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = Calories, y = Sodium)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Calories by Category

Which menu categories have the most calories? To answer this, we'll start by creating a barplot showing the the mean calories for each menu category

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 4, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = reorder(Category, -Calories), y = Calories, fill = Category)) +
  stat_summary(geom = "bar", fun.y = "mean") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

Here is a table showing summary statistics of each category

```{r}
Calories_agg <- mcdonalds %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = min(Calories),
    Mean = mean(Calories),
    Median = median(Calories),
    Max = max(Calories)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean))

kable(x = Calories_agg, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of McDonalds Menu item Calories")
```


### Regression analysis

What predicts Calories best? I conducted a regression analysis using the `lm()` function here are the main results:

```{r}
# Create regression model predicting Sodium from Calories

mcdonalds_select <- mcdonalds %>% select(Calories, 'Total Fat' , 'Sugars' , 'Carbohydrates') 
cal_sod_lm <- lm(Calories ~ .,
                 data = mcdonalds_select)

# Export cal_sod_lm to a nicely formatted table

kable(x = tidy(cal_sod_lm), 
      digits = 3, 
      caption = "Regression analysis predicting Calories from Total Fat, Sugars and Carbohydrates")
```
