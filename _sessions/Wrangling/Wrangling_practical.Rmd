## Overview

In this practical you'll practice "data wrangling" with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages (part of the `tidyverse collection of packages).

By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Change column names, select specific columns
2. Create new columns
3. Filter rows of data based on multiple criteria
4. Combine (aka, 'join') multiple data sets through key columns
5. Convert data between wide and long formats


## Tasks

### A - Setup

1. Open your `baselrbootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data files listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder

```{r}
# Done!
```

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `wrangling_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

```{r}
# Done!
```

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

4. For this practical, we'll use the `trial_act` data, this is the result of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of different medications on adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (You can learn more about the trial [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199610103351501)). Using the following template, load the data into R and store it as a new object called `trial_act`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load trial_act.csv from the data folder in your working directory

trial_act <- read_csv(file = "XX")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/trial_act.csv")
```

5. Using the same code structure, load the `trial_act_demo_fake.csv` data as a new dataframe called `trial_act_demo`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
trial_act <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/BaselRBootcamp_2018July/master/_sessions/_data/baselrbootcamp_data/trial_act.csv")

trial_act_demo <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/BaselRBootcamp_2018July/master/_sessions/_data/baselrbootcamp_data/trial_act_demo_fake.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trial_act_demo <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/trial_act_demo_fake.csv")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

6. Take a look at the first few rows of the datasets by printing them to the console.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print trial_act object
trial_act
```

7. Use the the `summary()` function to print more details on the columns of the datasets.

```{r}
summary(trial_act)
summary(trial_act_demo)
```

#### Tips

In this practical you will do many operations on dataframes. Remember: when using `dplyr`, you can chain multiple functions together with the pipe `%>%`. When giving your answers to the questions in this practical, see how many operations you can chain with the pipe!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
baselers <- read_csv("1_Data/baselers.csv")

# Method 1: Separate operations

baselers <- baselers %>%
              rename(Age_y = age)   # Change age to Age__y

baselers <- baselers %>%
              mutate(food_p = food / income)  # calculate food_p

baselers <- baselers %>%
              filter(sex == "m")    # Only include males

# Method 2: Chain with the pipe!

baselers <- read_csv("1_Data/baselers.csv")

baselers <- baselers %>%
              rename(Age_y = age) %>%             # Change age to Age__y
              mutate(food_p = food / income) %>%  # calculate food_p
              filter(sex == "m")                  # Only include males
```

### B - Change column names with rename()

1. Print the names of the `trial_act` data with `names(XXX)`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
names(XXX)
```

```{r}
names(trial_act)
```

2. Using `rename()`, change the column name `wtkg` in the `trial_act` dataframe to `weight_kg`. Be sure to assign the result back to `trial_act` to change it!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Change the name to weight_kg from wtkg

trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  rename(XX = XX)
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  rename(weight_kg = wtkg)
```

3. Look at the names of your `trial_act` dataframe again, do you now see the column `weight_kg`?

```{r}
names(trial_act)
```

4. Change the column name `age` to `age_y` (to specify that age is in years).

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  rename(age_y = age)
```

### C - Select columns with select()

1. Using the `select()` function, select only the column `age_y` and print the result (but don't assign it to anything). Do you see only the `age_y` column now?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX %>%
  select(XXX)
```

```{r}
trial_act %>% 
  select(age_y)
```

2. Using `select()` select the columns `pidnum`, `age_y`, `gender`, and `weight_kg` (but don't assign the result to anything)

3. Now it's time to create a new dataframe! Select the columns `pidnum`, `arms`, `cd40`, `cd420`, and `cd496` *and* assign the result to a new object called `CD4_wide`. The `cd40`, `cd420`, and `cd496` columns show patient's CD4 T cell counts at baseline, 20 weeks, and 96 weeks. After you create `CD4_wide`, print it to make sure it worked!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XX <- trial_act %>% 
  select(XX, XX, XX, XX, ...)
```

```{r}
CD4_wide <- trial_act %>%
  select(`pidnum`, `arms`, `cd40`, `cd420`, `cd496`)
```

4. Did you know you can easily select all columns that start with specific characters using `starts_with()`? Try adapting the following code to get the same result you got before.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CD4_wide <- trial_act %>% 
  select(pidnum, arms, starts_with("XXX"))
```

```{r}
CD4_wide <- trial_act %>% 
  select(pidnum, arms, starts_with("cd"))
```

5. A colleague wants an anonymised dataframe that does *not* contain the columns `pidnum` and `age`. Create this dataframe by selecting all columns *except* `pidnum` and `age` (hint: use the notation `select(-XXX, -XXX))` to select everything *except* specified columns

```{r}

```

### D - Add new columns with mutate()

1. Using the `mutate()` function, add the column `age_m` which shows each patient's age in months instead of years (Hint: Just multiply `age_y` by 12!)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(XX = XX * 12)
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(age_m = age_y * 12)
```

2. Using `mutate`, add the following new columns to `trial_act`. (Try combining these into *one* call to the `mutate()` function!)

- `weight_lb`: Weight in lbs instead of kilograms. You can do this by multiplying `weight_kg` by 2.2.
- `cd_change_20`: Change in CD4 T cell count from baseline to 20 weeks. You can do this by taking `cd420 - cd40`
- `cd_change_960`: Change in CD4 T cell count from baseline to 96 weeks. You can do this by taking `cd496 - cd40`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX <- XXX %>% 
  mutate(weight_lb = XXX,
         cd_change_20 = XXX,
         XXX = XXX)
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
  mutate(weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2,
         cd_change_20 = cd420 - cd40,
         cd_change_960 = cd496 - cd40)
```

3. If you look at the `gender` column, you will see that it is numeric (0s and 1s). Using the `mutate()` and `case_when()` functions, create a new column called `gender_char` which shows the gender as a string, where 0 = "female" and 1 = "male":
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Create gender_char which shows gender as a stringh
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(
  gender_char = case_when(
    gender == XX ~ "XX",
    gender == XX ~ "XX"))
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(
  gender_char = case_when(
    gender == 0 ~ "female",
    gender == 1 ~ "male"))
```

4. The column `arms` is also numeric and not very meaningful. Create a new column `arms_char` contains the names of the arms. Here is a table of the mapping

|arms|arms_char|
|:---|:-----|
|0|zidovudine|
|1|zidovudine and didanosine|
|2|zidovudine and zalcitabine|
|3|didanosine|

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(
  arms_char = case_when(
    arms == 0 ~ "zidovudine",
    arms == 1 ~ "zidovudine and didanosine",
    arms == 2 ~ "zidovudine and zalcitabine",
    arms == 3 ~ "didanosine"))
```

5. If you haven't already, try putting all the code for your previous questions in one call to `mutate()`. That is, in one block of code, create `age_m`, `weight_lb`, `cd_change_20`, `cd_change_960`, `gender_char` and `over50` using the `mutate()` function only once. Here's how your code should look:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(
    age_m = XXX,
    weight_lb = XXX,
    cd_change_20 = XXX,
    XXX = XXX,
    XXX = case_when(XXX),
    XXX = case_when(XXX)
  )
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(
    agem = age_y * 12,
    weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2,
    cd_change_20 = cd420 - cd40,
    cd_change_960 = cd496 - cd40,
    gender_char = case_when(
                      gender == 0 ~ "female",
                      gender == 1 ~ "male"),
   arms_char = case_when(
    arms == 0 ~ "zidovudine",
    arms == 1 ~ "zidovudine and didanosine",
    arms == 2 ~ "zidovudine and zalcitabine",
    arms == 3 ~ "didanosine")
  )
```

### E - Arrange rows with arrange()

1. Using the `arrange()` function, arrange the `trial_act` data in ascending order of `age_y` (from lowest to highest). After you do, print the data to make sure it worked!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
 arrange(XXX)
```


```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
 arrange(age_y)

trial_act
```

2. Now arrange the data in *descending* order of `age_y` (from highest to lowest). After, look the data to make sure it worked. To arrange data in descending order, just include `desc()` around the variable. E.g.; `data %>% arrrange(desc(height))`

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
 arrange(desc(age_y))

trial_act
```

3. You can sort the rows of dataframes with multiple columns by including many arguments to `arrange()`. Now sort the data by arms (`arms`) and then age_y (`age_y`). Print the result to make sure it looks right!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
 arrange(XXX, XXX)
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>% 
 arrange(arms, age_y)

trial_act
```

### F - Filter specific rows with `filter()`

1. Using the `filter()` function, filter only the rows from males (Hint: `gender_char == "male"`)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act %>%
  filter(XXX == "XXX")
```

```{r}
trial_act %>%
  filter(gender_char == "male")
```

2. Create a new dataframe called `trial_act_male` that only contains rows from males (hint: just assign what you did in the previous question to a new object!). After you create `trial_act_male`, print it to make sure it only contains data from males!

```{r}
trial_act_male <- trial_act %>%
  filter(gender_char == "male")

trial_act_male
```

3. Filter only rows for patients under the age of 60.

```{r}
trial_act %>%
  filter(age_y < 60)
```


4. A colleague of yours named Tracy wants a datafame only containing data from females over the age of 40. Create this dataframe with `filter()` and call it `trial_act_Tracy`. After you create the dataframe, print it to make sure it looks correct!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act_Tracy <- XXX %>%
  filter(XXX > XXX & XXX == XXX)
```

```{r}
trial_act_Tracy <- trial_act %>%
  filter(age_y > 40 & gender_char == "female")
```

### G - Combine dataframes with `left_join()`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
trial_act_demo <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_data/patient_demo.csv")

trial_act_demo
```

The `trial_act_demo.csv` file contains additional (fictional) demographic data about the patients, namely the number of days of exercise they get per week, and their highest level of education. Our goal is to add the demographic information to our `trial_act` data.

1. In order to combine the two dataframes, we need to find one 'key' column that we can use to match rows. Look at both the `trial_act` and `trial_act_demo` dataframes. Which column can we use as the 'key' column?

2. Use the `left_join()` function to combine the `trial_act` and `trial_act_demo` datasets, set the `by` argument to the name of the key column that is common in both data sets. Assign the result to `trial_act`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  left_join(XX, by = "XX")
```

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  left_join(trial_act_demo, by = "pidnum")
```

3. Print your new `trial_act` dataframe. Do you now see the demographic data?

```{r}
trial_act
```

### H - Reshaping with gather() and spread()

Remember the `CD4_wide` dataframe you created before? Currently it is in the *wide* format, where each row is a patient, where key data (different CD4 T cell counts) are in different columns like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
CD4_wide <- trial_act %>%
  select(`pidnum`, `arms`, `cd40`, `cd420`, `cd496`)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Data is in a 'wide' format
CD4_wide
```

Our goal is to convert this data to a 'long' format, where each row represents a single CD4 T cell count for a specific patient, like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
CD4_long <- CD4_wide %>% 
  gather(time,  # New grouping column
         value,  # New data column
         -pidnum, -arms)  # Names of columns to replicate
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# This is the same data in 'long' format
CD4_long
```

1. Using the `gather()` function, create a new dataframe called `CD4_long` that shows the `CD4_wide` data in the 'long' format. To do this, use the following template. Set the grouping column to `time` and the new data column to `value`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CD4_long <- CD4_wide %>% 
  gather(XX,  # New grouping column
         XX,  # New data column
         -pidnum, -arms)  # Names of columns to replicate
```

```{r}
CD4_long <- CD4_wide %>% 
  gather(time,  # New grouping column
         value,  # New data column
         -pidnum, -arms)  # Names of columns to replicate
```

2. Print your `CD4_long` dataframe! Do you now see that each row is a specific observation for a patient?

```{r}
CD4_long
```

3. Now use the `spread()` function to convert the long data bring the data *back* into the wide format! To do this, make the first argument `time`, and the second argument `value`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CD4_long %>%
  spread(XX,   # Grouping column
         XX)   # Value columnn
```

```{r}
CD4_long %>%
  spread(time, value)
```

### Practice!

1. Create a new dataframe called `trial_A` from `trial_act` with the following restrictions:

- Only patients who take intraveneous drugs (`drugs == 1`)
- Only patients younger than 60
- Only patients whose baseline CD4 T cell counts `cd40` were greater than 250 *and* less than 400.

```{r}
trial_A <- trial_act %>%
  filter(drugs == 1,
         age_y < 60,
         cd40 > 250 & cd40 < 400)

trial_A
```

2. Add a new column to `trial_act` called `drugs_char` which is `"User"` when drugs == 1, and `"Non User"` when drugs == 0.

```{r}
trial_act <- trial_act %>%
  mutate(drugs_char = case_when(
    drugs == 1 ~ "User",
    drugs == 0 ~ "Non User"
  ))

trial_act
```

3. Create a new dataframe called `trial_B` from `trial_act` with the following restrictions:

- Only patients whose CD4 T cell counts increase *more* than 200 between baseline (`cd40`) and after 96 weeks (`cd496`)
- Only drug users

```{r}
trial_B <- trial_act %>%
  filter(
    cd496 - cd40 > 200,
    drugs == 1
  )

trial_B
```

## Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr ---------------------------

library(tidyverse)    # Load tidyverse for dplyr and tidyr

# Load baselers data
baselers <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/baselers/master/inst/extdata/baselers.txt")

# Perform many dplyr operations in a row

baselers %>%
  
  # Change some names
  rename(age_y = age,
         swimming = rhine) %>%
  
  # Only include people over 30
  filter(age_y > 30) %>%
  
  # Calculate some new columns
  mutate(weight_lbs = weight * 2.22,
         height_m = height / 100,
         BMI = weight / height_m ^ 2,
         
         # Make binary version of sex
         sex_bin = case_when(
                      sex == "male" ~ 0,
                      sex == "female" ~ 1),

        # Show when height is greater than 150
        height_lt_150 = case_when(
                                height < 150 ~ 1,
                                height >= 150 ~ 0)) %>%
  
  # Sort in ascending order of sex, then
  #  descending order of age
  arrange(sex, desc(age_y)))
```
