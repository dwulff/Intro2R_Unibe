## Overview

In this practical you'll learn how to work with basic data objects and functions. By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Create vectors of different types using `c()`
2. Understand the three main vector classes numeric, character, and logical using `class()` 
3. Calculate basic descriptive statistics using `mean()`, `median()`, `table()` (and more!)
4. Read and write data of various data formats using `read_csv()` and others 
5. Access and change vectors from data frames using `$`
6. Create `data.frames` and `tibbles` using `data.frame()` and `tibble()`

## Tasks

### A - Getting setup

1. Open your `BernRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`.

2. Open a new R script and save it as a new file called `data_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. 
Then, load all package(s) listed in the Packages section above with `library()`. Make sure that each of the datasets listed above lie in your `1_Data` folder.

### B - Creating vectors

The table below shows results from a (fictional) survey of 10 Baselers. In the first part of this practical, you will convert this table to R objects and then analyse them!

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data <- baselers[1:10, c("id", "sex", "age", "height", "weight")]

data %>% mutate_all(replace_na, " ") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "markdown", caption = "Data from 10 baselers")
```

1. Create a numeric vector called `id` that shows the id values. When you finish, print the vector object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a vector id
XX <- c(XX, XX, ...)

# Print the vector id
XX
```

```{r}
# Create an id vector 
id <- 1:10 # shortcut to creating the sequence from 1 to 10

# Print the vector
id
```

2. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `id` vector. Is it `"numeric"`?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Show the class of an object XX
class(XX)
```

```{r}
# Show the class of the id vector
class(id)
```

3. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `id` vector. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Show the length of the id vector
length(XX)
```

```{r}
# Show the length of the id vector
length(id)
```

4. Create a character vector called `sex` that shows the sex values. Make sure to use quotation marks "" to enclose each element to tell R that the data are of type `"character"`! When you finish, print the object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a character vector sex
XX <- c("XX", "XX", "...")
```

```{r}
# Create a sex vector 
sex <- c("male", "male", "female", "male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "male", "female")

# Print the vector
sex
```

5. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `sex` vector. Is it  `"character"`?

```{r}
# Show the class of the sex vector
class(sex)
```

6. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `sex` object. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

```{r}
# Show the length of the sex vector
length(sex)
```

7. Using the same steps as before, create a `age` and `height` vector.

```{r}
# Create a age vector 
age <- c(44, 65, 31, 27, 24, 63, 71, 41, 43, 31)

# Print the age vector
age

# Show the class of the age vector
class(age)

# Show the length of the age vector
length(age)

# Create a height vector 
height <- c(174.3, 180.3, 168.3, 209, 176.7, 186.6, 151.6, 155.7, 176.1, 166.1)

# Print the height vector
height

# Show the class of the height vector
class(height)

# Show the length of the height vector
length(height)
```

8. Look at the weight data, you'll notice it contains an missing value. Create a vector called `weight` containing these data, following the same steps as before, making sure to specify the missing value as `NA` (no quotation marks). 

```{r}
# Create a weight vector 
weight <- c(113.4, 75.2, 55.5, 93.8, NA, 67.4, 83.3, 67.8, 69.3, 66.3)

# Print the weight vector
weight

# Show the class of the weight vector
class(weight)

# Show the length of the weight vector
length(weight)
```

### C - Functions

1. Using the `table()` function, find out how many males and females are in the data. You should find `r sum(data$sex == "male")` males and `r sum(data$sex == "female")` females!

```{r}
# Count types in sex
table(sex)
```

2. Using the `mean()` function, calculate the mean `age`. It should be `r mean(data$age)`!

```{r}
# Compute mean of age
mean(age)
```

3. Try calculating the mean value of `sex`. What happens? Why?

```{r}
# Compute mean of sex
mean(sex)
```

4. Try calculating the mean `weight`. You should get an `NA` value. Why?

```{r}
# Compute mean of sex
mean(weight)
```

5. Look at the help menu for the `mean()` function (using `?mean`) to look for an argument that will help you with your problem.

```{r}
# Inspect help for mean
?mean
```

6. Using the correct argument for the mean function, calculate the mean weight ignoring `NA` values. It should be `r round(mean(data$weight, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`!

```{r}
# Compute mean weight, ignoring NAs 
mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### D - Read & write delim-separated text files

In this section, you will read in a subset of the well known diamonds data set and prepare it for data analysis. 

1. Identify the file path to the `diamonds.csv` dataset using the `""` (quotation marks) auto-complete trick. Place the cursor between two quotation marks, hit &#8677; (tab-key), and browse through the folders. Save the file path, for now, in an object called `diamonds_path`.

```{r, eval = F, echo =T}
# place cursor in-between "" and hit tab
diamonds_path <- ""
```


```{r}
# place cursor in-between and hit tab
diamonds_path <- "1_Data/diamonds.csv"
```

2. Now use the Using `diamonds_path` insdide the `read_csv()` function to read in the `diamonds.csv` dataset. Store it as a new object called `diamonds`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# read diamonds data
diamonds <- read_csv(file = XX)
```

```{r}
# read diamonds data
diamonds <- read_csv(file = diamonds_path)
```

3. Print the `diamonds` data and inspect the column names in the header line. Something's wrong!

```{r}
# print diamonds
diamonds
```

4. Fix the header by reading in the data again using the `col_names`-argument. Assign to `col_names` a character vector containing the correct column names: `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, `depth`, `table`, `price`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# read diamonds data with specified col_names
diamonds <- read_csv(file = "XX", 
                     col_names = c('name_1','name_2','...'))  # Vector of column names
```

```{r}
# read diamonds data with specified col_names
diamonds <- read_csv(file = diamonds_path,
                     col_names = c("carat", "cut", "color", "clarity", "depth", "table", "price"))
```

5. Re-inspect the header by printing the data. Has the header been fixed?

```{r}
# print diamonds
diamonds
```

6. Now pay attention to the classes of the individuals columns (variables). Have all classes been identified correctly? What about the `carat` column? It should be `numeric`, right?

7. Let's see what went wrong. Select and print the `carat` variable to identify the one entry that caused the variable to become a `character` vector (Hint: look for a comma between entry 10 and 20). 

```{r}
# print the carat column
diamonds$carat
```

8. Change the incorrectly formated entry in `carat` by replacing `XX` with the index of the incorrect value (i.e., the correct number between 10 and 20) and `YY` with the correct entry with a period (`.`) instead of a comma (`,`) in the code below.  

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# Change the value at position XX to YY
diamonds$carat[XX] <- YY
```

```{r}
# Change the value at position XX to YY
diamonds$carat[17] <- 0.37
```

9. Ok you fixed the value but `carat` is still `character`. We can fix it with the `type_convert()` function. Apply the `type_convert()` function to the `diamonds` data to have R fix all the data types. Make sure to assign the result back to `diamonds` so that you change the object!

```{r, echo = T}
# re-infer data types
diamonds <- type_convert(diamonds)
```

10. Print the `diamonds` object and look at the column types. Has the type of `carat` changed to `double`?

```{r}
# print diamonds data set
diamonds
```

11. Write the, now, properly formatted diamonds data to your data folder as a `.csv` file using the name `diamonds_clean.csv`. Don't forget to include both the file name and the folder (separated by `/`) in the character string specifying the `path` argument. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# write clean diamonds data to disc
write_csv(x = XX, path = "XX")
```

```{r}
# write clean diamonds data to disc
write_csv(x = diamonds, "1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
```

12. Read `diamonds_clean.csv` back into R as a new object called `diamonds_clean`. Then, print the object and verify that this time the types been correctly identified from the start.

```{r}
# read clean diamonds data from disc
diamonds_clean <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
```

13. The data is now ready for analysis. Explore it a bit by calculating a few statistics. For instance, what is the average `carat` or `price` (use `mean()`)? What  `cut` and `clarity` levels exist and how often do they occur (use `table()` on both variables)? You can learn more about the variable values from the help file `?diamonds`.

```{r}
# simple stats of diamonds
mean(diamonds$carat)
mean(diamonds$price)
table(diamonds$cut)
table(diamonds$clarity)
```


### E - Logical Vectors and `$`

1. Logical vectors contain as values only `TRUE` and `FALSE` (and `NA`s). Create a new logical vector called `expensive` indicating which diamonds are more expensive than \$10000. To do this, select the `price` variable from the data frame using `$` use the `>` (greater than) operator á la `vector > value`.  

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a logical vector expensive indicating
# which dimaonds cost more than 10,000

ZZ <- diamonds$XX > YY
```

```{r}
# Create a logical vector expensive indicating
# which dimaonds cost more than 10,000

expensive <- diamonds$price > 10000
```

2. Print your `expensive` vector to the console. Do you see only TRUE and FALSE values? If so, do the first few values match those in the `price` variable?

```{r}
# print expensive
expensive
```

3. Add your `expensive` vector to the diamonds data frame using `data_frame$variable_name <- variable`. See below?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# add vector to data frame
XX$YY <- ZZ
```

```{r}
# add vector to data frame
diamonds$expensive <- expensive
```

4. Using the `table()` function, create a table showing how many of the diamonds are expensive how many are not. Select the variable directly from the data frame using `$`.

```{r}
# count expensive diamonds
table(diamonds$expensive)
```

5. Using the `mean()` function, determine the percentage of the diamonds that are expensive, i.e., `mean(expensive)`. Should this have worked?

```{r}
# percentage of expensive diamonds
mean(diamonds$expensive)
```

6. What percent diamonds weigh more than 1 `carat` (i.e., more than .2 gram)?

```{r}
# percentage of diamonds heavier than 1 carat
mean(diamonds$carat > 1)
```

### F - Read other file formats

#### Excel

```{r, out.width = "8%", fig.align = 'left', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg/2000px-Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg.png")
```

1. Using `read_excel()`, read in the `titanic.xls` dataset as a new object called `titanic` (Make sure you have alredy loaded the `readxl` package at the beginning of your script).

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
titanic <- read_excel(path = "XX")
```

```{r}
# Read titanic data
titanic <- read_excel("1_Data/titanic.xls")
```

2. Print `titanic` and evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r}
# print and show dimenisons
titanic
dim(titanic)
```

3. Using `table()`, how many people survived (variable `survived`) in each cabin class (variable `pclass`)?

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# determine survival rate by cabin class
table(titanic$XX, 
      titanic$XX)
```

```{r}
# determine survival rate by cabin class
table(titanic$pclass, titanic$survived)
```

4. Using `write_csv()`, write the `titanic` dataframe as a new comma separated text file called `titanic.csv` in your `1_Data`  folder. Now you have the data saved as a text file any software can use!

```{r}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(x = titanic, 
          path = "1_Data/titanic.csv")
```

#### SPSS 

```{r, out.width = "8%", fig.align = 'left', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.sqlearn.gr/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2000px-SPSS_logo.jpg")
```

5. Using `read_spss()` read in the sleep data set `sleep.sav` of staff at he University of Melbourne as a new object called `sleep`. (Make sure that you have first loaded the `haven` package).

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
XX <- read_spss(file = "XX")
```

```{r}
# Read sleep data
sleep <- read_spss(file = "1_Data/sleep.sav")
```

6. Print your `sleep` object and evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r}
# print and show dimensions
sleep
dim(sleep)
```

7. How many drinks do staff at the University of Melbourne consumer per day (variable `alcohol`). To do this, use the `mean()` function, while taking care of missing values using the `na.rm` argument. 

```{r}
# compute mean number of drinks
mean(x = sleep, na.rm = TRUE)
```

8. Using the `write_csv()` function, write the `sleep` data to a new file called `sleep.csv` in your `1_Data` folder. Now you have the `sleep` data stored as a text file any software can use!

```{r}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(x = sleep, 
          path = "1_Data/sleep.csv")
```


#### SAS

```{r, out.width = "8%", fig.align = 'left', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/SAS_logo_horiz.svg")
```

9. Using `read_sas()`, read in `airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat` containing AirBnB listings in Zürich, Switzerland and call the object `airbnb_zuerich`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# read sas data
XX <- read_sas(data_file = "XX")
```

```{r}
# read airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat
airbnb_zuerich <- read_sas(data_file = "1_Data/airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat")
```

10. Print `airbnb_zuerich` and then evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r}
# print and show dimenisons
airbnb_zuerich
dim(airbnb_zuerich)
```

11. How many AirBnB listings were there of each `room_type` in Zürich? (Hint: use `table()`)

```{r}
# table room type
table(airbnb_zuerich$room_type)
```

12. Using `write_csv()` write your `airbnb_zuerich` data frame to as new comma-separated text file called `airbnb_zuerich.csv` in your `1_Data` folder.

```{r}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(x = airbnb_zuerich, 
          path = "1_Data/airbnb_zuerich.csv")
```

### G - Creating data frames

1. Using the `data.frame()` function, create a data frame called `ten_df` that contains each of the vectors you just created: `id`, `age`, `sex`, `height`, `weight`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create data frame ten_df containing vectors id, age, sex, height, and weight.
XX <- data.frame(XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX) 
```

```{r}
# Create ten_df data frame from vectors
ten_df <- data.frame(id, age, sex, height, weight) 
```

2. Print your `ten_df` object to see how it looks! Does it contain all of the vectors?

```{r}
# Print ten_df
ten_df
```

3. Using the `dim()` function, print the number of rows and columns in your data frame. Do you get 10 rows and 5 columns?

```{r}
# Inspect dimensions
dim(ten_df)
```

4. What is the class of your `ten_df` object? Use the `class()` function to find out!

```{r}
# Inspect class
class(ten_df)
```

5. Use the `summary()` function to print descriptive statistics from each column of `ten_df`

```{r}
# Inspect class
summary(ten_df)
```

6. Using the `$` operator, print the `age` column from the `ten_df` data frame.

```{r}
# Inspect age
ten_df$age
```

7. Calculate the maximum `age` value from the `ten_df` data frame using `max()`. Do you get the same result from when you calculated it from the original vector `age`?

```{r}
# Get max
max(ten_df$age)
```

8. Instead of creating a data frame of the data using the `data.frame()` function, try creating a tibble called `ten_tibble` using the `tibble()` function. `tibble`s are a more modern, leaner variant of data frame that we prefer over classic `data.frame`. You can use the exact same arguments you used before.

```{r}
# create tibble
ten_tibble = tibble(id, age, sex, height, weight)
```

9. Print your new `ten_tibble` object, how does it look different from `ten_df`? Try calculating the maximum `age` from this object. Is it different from what you got before?

```{r}
# print tibble
ten_tibble
max(ten_tibble$age) == max(ten_df$age)
```

### X - Challenges

1. If you take the `sum()` of a logical vector, R will return the number of cases that are `TRUE`. Using this, find out how many of the ten Baselers are male while using the is-equal-to operator `==`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Determine the frequency of a case in a vector
sum(XX == XX)
```

```{r}
# Determine the frequency of a case in a vector
sum(ten_tibble$sex == "male")
```

2. You can use logical vectors to select rows from a data frame based on certain criteria. using the following template, get the id values of Baselers who are younger than 30:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a logical vector indicating which baselers are younger than 30
young_30 <- XX$XX < 30

# Print the ids of baselers younger than 30
XX$XX[young_30]
```

```{r}
# Create a logical vector indicating which baselers are younger than 30
young_30 <- ten_tibble$age < 30

# Print the ids of baselers younger than 30
ten_tibble$id[young_30]
```

3. Use a combination of logical vectors and the `mean()` function to answer the question: "What is the mean age of Baselers who are heavier than 80kg?"

```{r}
# Mean age of baselers heavier than 80kg
mean(ten_tibble$age[ten_tibble$weight > 80])
```

4. What are the id values of Baselers who are male *and* are shorter than 165cm? (Hint: You will need to use the logical AND operator `&` to combine multiple logical vectors)

```{r}
# Mean age of baselers heavier than 80kg
ten_tibble$id[ten_tibble$sex == "male" & ten_tibble$height < 165]
```

## Examples
